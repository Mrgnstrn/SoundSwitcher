Hello! This is my small application that allows you to quickly switch the sound output between desktop speakers and headphones.
Its very convenient for multichannel sound cards, drivers that do not allow you to do this automatically.
And as there is no need to manually connect headphones, especially if the connector is at the rear of the system unit.
Of course you must first configure the program for your computer. To do this, go to the section "Playback Devices" and make sure there are at least two channels for different devices except the mixer. With the sound test (see right mouse button menu), verify which of them you have connected speakers and headphones, remember their names and select in the program.

You can (and should) quickly switch through a double-click on the trayicon.

The program does not require installation and does not leave traces in the system, except for startup. To use, first put the program in a fixed place on the disk, and then activate the autostart. 
The OK button saves the configuration. The Refresh button updates the list of devices.

WBR!
